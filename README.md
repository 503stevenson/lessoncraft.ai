# Lessoncraft
Lessoncraft is a brand new platform that allows users to build and share learning material with the power of AI. Just drag and drop large pdfs of content that you want to learn(or teach) and we will build an easy-to-understand lesson plan for you! You can even group lessons together into largercourses for more detailed learning.
